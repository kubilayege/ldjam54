   Volfied but reversed: Enemies claim territory, and the player must interrupt them to reclaim that space. When the player runs out of space, the round ends. In the new round, the player can spend their gained score, gold, or coins in the shop to purchase power-ups and weapons. Each weapon/power-up can be used for a limited time. Enemies can be defeated, but they respawn after 10 seconds. Each round lasts up to 5 minutes maximum, with the last 1 minute being a rush for the enemies. During this time, enemies gain a speed boost and a shield. Each enemy has a different shield timer. Enemies use their shields while staying or moving on the edges. If they start claiming the space, their shields will run out, making them vulnerable.  

## Story
   It was a long trip as the spaceship "Monotros" returned to its planet, "Volfied." However, Volfied had already turned into ruins due to an alien invasion! At that time, they received an "SOS" signal from underground and decided to rescue the people from the aliens.

   In the end...

   The aliens were exterminated, and the spaceship Monotros discovered the lone survivor. They lost everything, but they resolved to make a fresh start in life as the new Adam and Eve of this planet!

   But was there really an alien invasion?

   The planet Volfied already had its inhabitants. The Volfiedian race had lived peacefully long before humans discovered it. Due to human greed and the exploitation of natural resources, the planet Volfied was overrun, and generations of Volfiedians were pushed to the brink of extinction.

   The uprising did not bring happiness, and war erupted between the human and Volfiedian races, resulting in defeat for the humans who then went into hiding underground.

   The Monotros ship once again brought the Volfiedian race to the brink of extinction while allowing the human race to thrive.

   However, the human race forgot one crucial thing: the Volfiedians had a hive mind and didn't die easily. The captain of the Monotros ship and his wife, whom he rescued, initiated the colonization of the new human race on the planet Volfied, leading to a significant increase in the human population.

   Riwmoni, a member of the Volfiedian race, thanks to his years in hiding and the long life his race had granted him, had witnessed the atrocities committed by the human race and dedicated himself to saving his planet.

   What he had done to the planet Monotros, Riwmoni now sought to do to the humans!

# Gameplay and Mechanics

## Gameplay

- Enemies try to claim an area, and the player must prevent them from doing so within a 5-minute playtime. If the enemy takes a specific percentage of the playground area, the round ends. Rounds can also end due to a time limit. Players gain scores, gold, or coins at the end of each round, which can be spent in the shop to purchase weapons and power-ups.

## Purpose

- The player's purpose is to prevent the enemies from claiming a specific percentage of the playing area within a 5-minute time limit. The player's goal is to defend the territory and ensure that the enemies do not achieve their objective. Additionally, the player can earn scores, gold, or coins during the game rounds, which can be used to purchase weapons and power-ups to aid in their mission of thwarting the enemy's advances.

## Mechanics

- Enemies claim the map grid by grid.
- The player can interrupt enemy claims.
  - If an enemy starts to claim a grid, it becomes vulnerable, and the player can eliminate it.
- Enemies can't claim a small area if the player is in it.
  - If the player becomes vulnerable, enemies can claim the player's space.
- Enemies have shields during the round for x seconds.
