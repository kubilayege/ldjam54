   At the end...

   The aliens were exterminated and the spaceship monotros discovered the one survivor. They lost all things.. But, they made up their mind to make a fresh start of life as the new adam & eve of this planet!

   Was there really an alien invasion?

   The planet Volfied already had a host. The Volfiedian race lived peacefully long before humans discovered it. Due to human greed and natural resources, the planet Volfied was overrun and generations were on the brink of genocide.

   The uprising did not make people happy and war broke out. The war between the human and Volfiedian races ended in defeat for the human race and the humans went into hiding underground.

   The Monotros ship once again brought the Volfiedian race to the brink of extinction and allowed the human race to flourish again.

   But the human race has forgotten one thing. The Volfiedians had a hive mind and did not die so easily. The captain of the Monotros ship and his wife, whom he rescued, started a colonization of the new human race on the planet Volfied and the number of the human race increased.

   Riwmoni was a member of the Volfidian race who, thanks to his years in hiding and the long life his race had given him, had seen the atrocities committed by the human race and dedicated himself to saving his planet. 

   What he did to the planet Monotros, Riwmoni now returns to do to humans!
